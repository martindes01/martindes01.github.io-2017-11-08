## About

This is an experimental static blog originally deployed to my GitHub Pages user site at [martindes01.github.io](https://martindes01.github.io).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

A local web server is required to run the site locally.
This can be achieved using the [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) `http.server` module, as described [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server).

### Installation

Simply clone the source from this repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/martindes01/martindes01.github.io-2017-11-08.git
cd martindes01.github.io-2017-11-08
```

## Usage

To run the site locally, start a web server in the root directory.
This can be achieved by running the Python 3 `http.server` module, optionally specifying a port number `<port>`.
This will serve the contents of the directory to `localhost:<port>`.
If unspecified, `<port>` defaults to `8000`.

```shell
python3 -m http.server [<port>]
```
