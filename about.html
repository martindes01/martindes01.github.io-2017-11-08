                            was born in Luton at the end of last century and quickly showed a keen interest in mathematics and the sciences.

                            It is a great pity then, that the world did not know the same.
                            I was a lame duck, (not a metaphorical lame duck either, but a real duck that was actually lame — probably from stepping on a land mine).
                            Frail, emaciated, and without a penny to my name, I knew then, I had to git gud.

                            What I learn, I shall use to make voyage to the dark side of the Moon, where I vow to uncover the horrifying truth that the Government so wishes to hide from us.
