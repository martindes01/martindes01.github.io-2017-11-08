                            was born in Luton at the end of last century and quickly showed a keen interest in mathematics and the sciences.
                            At the tender age of five months he unlocked the secrets of RedBull and can now force wings to sprout from his back at will."

                            It is a great pity then,
                            that the world did not know the same.
                            I was a lame duck,

                            probably from stepping on a land mine).
                            Frail, emaciated, and without a penny to my name,
                            I knew then,

                            studying Mechanical Engineering at the University of Birmingham.
                            This blog shall be my journal,
                            and I make it so that should I fall,
                            it should not be in vain.
                            What I learn,
                            I shall use to make voyage to the dark side of the Moon,
                            where I will discover the horrifying truth that the Government so wishes to hide from us.
